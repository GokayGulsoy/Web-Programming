           known layered approach is known as TCP/IP protocol suite in which <br>
           network is categorized into five layers consisting of Application layer,
           Transport layer, <br>Network layer, Data-Link layer and Physical layer.
           Each layer deals with a different <br> service that is required for 
           the communication of computers over a network.

               <br> because many real-life problems can be modeled in terms of objects, some <br> important concepts in 
               object orientation are inheritence,polymorphism, and <br> enapsulation becasue these features allow resusable
               software development <br> so that software developers don't need to write the same or similar code over <br> and

                languages from different <br> paradigms examples of these paradigms can be procedural languages, object-oriented <br>
                languages, functional languages, logic languages. Also it deals with the concepts that are <br> used by different
                programming languages such as scoping, binding, control-flow,<br> data abstraction, concurreny and many more.
